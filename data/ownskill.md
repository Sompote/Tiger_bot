## Updated
2025-01-28

## Skills Learned
- **tiangong-notebooklm-cli** (v0.1.1): NotebookLM CLI wrapper; requires browser OAuth (incompatible with cloud/headless environments)
- **youtube-transcript**: Extracts video transcripts without API keys; effective fallback when NotebookLM auth fails
- **schedule**: Configured for 12-hour self-training automation cycles
- **bird**: X/Twitter search tool (requires X Bearer Token/paid API)
- **search-x**: X/Twitter search via xAI API ($5/month tier)
- **searxng-local-search**: Identified as potential no-API search alternative

## Recent Work Summary
- **X/Twitter Search Audit**: Evaluated 5+ Twitter skills; determined all require paid API access (X API changes 2023). Established web search with `site:x.com` as viable no-API alternative.
- **NotebookLM Integration Attempt**: Installed CLI wrapper but blocked by Google OAuth browser requirement. Documented limitation for cloud environments.
- **YouTube Analysis Workflow**: Deployed `youtube-transcript` → direct analysis pipeline as functional replacement for NotebookLM video processing.
- **Self-Training Automation**: Implemented 12-hour update cycle using `schedule` skill to append learnings to memory files.

## Known Limits
- **NotebookLM CLI**: Requires interactive browser authentication; no service account or token-based auth available for headless/cloud deployment.
- **X/Twitter Skills**: 100% require paid API keys (X Bearer Token or xAI API); no functional no-API Twitter search skills exist in ClawHub.
- **DuckDuckGo Search**: CAPTCHA blocking automated queries; `super-web-websearch-realtime` preferred but model-dependent.
- **Auth Persistence**: Cannot persist Google OAuth sessions across container/cloud restarts without manual token export.

## Next Improvements
- Evaluate **serpapi** or **tavily** skills for better no-API web search reliability
- Test **beautifulsoup4-scraper** for Nitter/X direct parsing (unofficial, TOS-risk)
- Implement **token export workflow** for NotebookLM: user authenticates locally, exports cookie/token, imports to cloud environment
- Research **Google Service Account** support for NotebookLM API (if available)
- Add **persistent-memory** skill for structured learning storage beyond markdown files

- [2026-02-18] User may be testing the bot, unsure how to interact, or waiting for a response before proceeding.
- [2026-02-18] No assistant responses are visible; unclear if the bot responded at all, which may explain repeated greetings.

- [2026-02-18] User is comfortable cancelling tasks with short messages like '1 ไม่ต้อง ทำ'.
- [2026-02-18] User tends to use slash commands (e.g., /token) during sessions.
- [2026-02-18] Assistant displayed pending task summaries proactively on 'Hi' — this seems appropriate given the task backlog context.
- [2026-02-18] A Kimi API key (sk-qgwx...) was previously shared in chat; assistant correctly flagged it for revocation without storing the key.
- [2026-02-18] Assistant maintained task list across messages and presented it clearly in table format on session start.
