• Accepts proactive recommendations for system improvements and migrations
• Interested in: SQLite, vector databases, semantic search, and persistent storage solutions

## Update 2026-02-15T07:13:20.399Z
- Had embedding issue requiring fix for 384-dim vector memory system
- Uses local Python embedding generator (scikit-learn TF-IDF, 384-dim, no API)
- Works with multilingual data (English + Thai)
- Uses SQLite database with semantic/vector search capabilities
- Prefers local/offline solutions over API-dependent services

## Update 2026-02-15T07:16:33.622Z
• Testing vector search & semantic memory retrieval systems
• Interested in dementia/Alzheimer's-related search applications
• Validates system functionality (debugging/QA behavior)
• Uses multilingual interfaces (English/Thai)

## Update 2026-02-15T07:18:30.220Z
• Primary language: Thai (native/fluent)
• Testing vector search & multilingual retrieval
• Technical user: infrastructure/DB validation

- Summary: User is a technical researcher from KMUTT Civil Engineering AI Research Group managing Tiger bot infrastructure. Conversation spans security hardening (SQLite permissions, gitignore, audit logging), vector database repairs (embedding generation), and content creation (Facebook posts, Thai language guides). User prefers concise, structured outputs with tables and validates functionality through explicit testing.
- Pattern: Security-first approach: Requests security improvements before features
- Pattern: Bilingual workflow: Switches between Thai and English based on context (technical vs. content creation)
- Pattern: Validation-driven: Explicitly tests implementations (database health, vector search, Thai embeddings)
- Pattern: Conciseness preference: Multiple requests for 'กระชับ' (concise) content
- Pattern: Structured data preference: Favors tables, checklists, and command references over prose
- Pattern: Platform-specific documentation: Requests tailored guides (Hetzner Cloud, Telegram, Facebook)
- Lesson: Initial misinterpretation: 'Facebook' request assumed installation platform rather than content destination
- Lesson: Embedding gap: Vector search installed but embeddings empty, requiring manual fix
- Lesson: Temporary storage risk: Database initially in /tmp/ with world-readable permissions
- Lesson: Session persistence: User had to repeat 'Revise readme' command multiple times (possible connection drops)
- Workflow: Tiered security implementation: HIGH (permissions, gitignore) → MEDIUM (backup, audit logging) prioritization
- Workflow: Git hygiene: Committing security templates while excluding credentials
- Workflow: Vector search repair: Python fallback embedding generation (384-dim) enabling semantic Thai→English search
- Workflow: Competitive positioning: Tiger vs Clawbot comparison highlighting memory persistence and security
- Workflow: Institutional branding: Adding KMUTT affiliation to documentation
