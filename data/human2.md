## Update 2026-02-15T07:23:49.156Z
- Summary: User is a technical researcher from KMUTT Civil Engineering AI Research Group managing Tiger bot infrastructure. Conversation spans security hardening (SQLite permissions, gitignore, audit logging), vector database repairs (embedding generation), and content creation (Facebook posts, Thai language guides). User prefers concise, structured outputs with tables and validates functionality through explicit testing.
- Pattern: Security-first approach: Requests security improvements before features
- Pattern: Bilingual workflow: Switches between Thai and English based on context (technical vs. content creation)
- Pattern: Validation-driven: Explicitly tests implementations (database health, vector search, Thai embeddings)
- Pattern: Conciseness preference: Multiple requests for 'กระชับ' (concise) content
- Pattern: Structured data preference: Favors tables, checklists, and command references over prose
- Pattern: Platform-specific documentation: Requests tailored guides (Hetzner Cloud, Telegram, Facebook)
- Lesson: Initial misinterpretation: 'Facebook' request assumed installation platform rather than content destination
- Lesson: Embedding gap: Vector search installed but embeddings empty, requiring manual fix
- Lesson: Temporary storage risk: Database initially in /tmp/ with world-readable permissions
- Lesson: Session persistence: User had to repeat 'Revise readme' command multiple times (possible connection drops)
- Workflow: Tiered security implementation: HIGH (permissions, gitignore) → MEDIUM (backup, audit logging) prioritization
- Workflow: Git hygiene: Committing security templates while excluding credentials
- Workflow: Vector search repair: Python fallback embedding generation (384-dim) enabling semantic Thai→English search
- Workflow: Competitive positioning: Tiger vs Clawbot comparison highlighting memory persistence and security
- Workflow: Institutional branding: Adding KMUTT affiliation to documentation

## Update 2026-02-18T23:31:45.813Z
- Summary: User Sompote (telegram:8172556270) is working on the Tiger_bot project (GitHub: Sompote/Tiger_bot, repo path /root/tiger). Primary issues: GitHub PAT expired and git push showing 'Everything up-to-date' without actually updating remote files. Workaround was GitHub REST API direct upload. Files db.py, tiger_agent.py, token_manager.py confirmed uploaded via API but not visible via git push. User also requested Kimi API key change.
- Pattern: User frequently types 'Run' as a standalone message to execute previously planned commands.
- Pattern: User's GitHub PAT tokens expire/get revoked; they provide new tokens in plaintext in chat.
- Pattern: git push reports 'Everything up-to-date' or 'success' but files do not appear on GitHub remote — likely a git local/remote SHA divergence or branch tracking issue.
- Pattern: GitHub REST API PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{file} successfully uploads files when git push fails.
- Pattern: User sends many short messages ('Hi', 'Hello') possibly testing connectivity or bot responsiveness.
- Pattern: User requested switching to Kimi API with a provided API key in plaintext.
- Lesson: Old GitHub token (redacted) was invalid/expired — always verify token before use.
- Lesson: git push returning 'Everything up-to-date' is misleading; local commits were not actually reaching remote — need to verify remote SHA matches local SHA after push.
- Lesson: Simulated/fake shell output was shown to user (file sizes, commit SHAs) without real execution results, causing confusion and distrust.
- Lesson: API upload showed 201 Created but files disappeared on re-check — possible branch/ref mismatch or repo visibility issue.
- Lesson: Do not expose or log API keys and GitHub tokens in responses or memory summaries.
- Lesson: Investigating whether GitHub blocks pushes from certain automation tools (OpenClaw/bot) was requested but not resolved.
- Workflow: GitHub REST API direct file upload: GET file to retrieve SHA if exists, then PUT with base64 content, message, branch, and sha fields — returned 201 and files appeared in API listing.
- Workflow: Token verification via GET https://api.github.com/user with Bearer header confirms token validity before operations.
- Workflow: Checking all branches via GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches and default branch via GET /repos/{owner}/{repo} to confirm correct target branch.

## Update 2026-02-18T23:43:54.574Z
- Summary: User sent repeated greetings ('Hi' and 'Hello') over ~12 minutes with no substantive conversation or requests made.
- Pattern: User repeatedly sends simple greetings without following up with a request or question.
- Pattern: User may be testing the bot, unsure how to interact, or waiting for a response before proceeding.
- Lesson: No assistant responses are visible; unclear if the bot responded at all, which may explain repeated greetings.
- Lesson: Lack of engagement or prompt from the assistant may cause users to repeat themselves.

## Update 2026-02-18T23:48:09.407Z
- Summary: User greeted assistant twice with 'Hi', then cancelled task #1 (GitHub block push check), leaving only the Kimi API key rotation as pending work. The /token command was sent at the end of the session.
- Pattern: User sends multiple 'Hi' messages to initiate sessions without additional context.
- Pattern: User is comfortable cancelling tasks with short messages like '1 ไม่ต้อง ทำ'.
- Pattern: User tends to use slash commands (e.g., /token) during sessions.
- Lesson: Assistant displayed pending task summaries proactively on 'Hi' — this seems appropriate given the task backlog context.
- Lesson: A Kimi API key (sk-qgwx...) was previously shared in chat; assistant correctly flagged it for revocation without storing the key.
- Workflow: Assistant maintained task list across messages and presented it clearly in table format on session start.
- Workflow: Assistant correctly advised against sharing new API keys in chat and suggested secure alternatives (env variable or .env file).

## Update 2026-02-18T23:50:09.572Z
- Summary: User checked token configuration for the Tiger project. System has multi-provider LLM setup with Z.ai currently active, Kimi and Claude keys set, MiniMax and Moonshot missing keys.
- Pattern: User uses /token command to inspect LLM provider configuration
- Pattern: Project is located at /root/tiger/ with .env config file
- Pattern: User manages multiple LLM providers with failover ordering
- Workflow: /token command successfully displays provider status table with keys, models, and daily limits

## Update 2026-02-19T00:00:14.939Z
- Summary: Brief greeting interaction with user via Telegram. Assistant responded in Thai, offering menu options for provider/API key changes.
- Pattern: User communicates via Telegram (ID: 8172556270)
- Pattern: Assistant defaults to Thai language responses for this user
- Pattern: Assistant proactively offers common action menu on greeting
- Workflow: Greeting with Thai language response and action menu prompt works as expected
